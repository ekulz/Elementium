---------- Description:
-----------------------
This game is a side scrolling, platform puzzler in which four elementals - Earth, Water, Fire, and Air - have arrived on the planet Elementium. They must complete each level in the fastest time possible to prove who is the greater elemental. Each elemental has a certain set of skills which enable them to take different paths throughout the same level. Some elementals may have an easier path than others, which greatly benefits their ability to speed run through levels.


---------- Instructions:
------------------------
Reach the level end in each map.
 
Figure out which obstacles each elemental can use to their advantage, which will slow them down or possibly kill them.

The timer will begin counting as soon as you spawn, and if you manage to finish the level with the fastest time it will record the time, along with your elemental that was used, and place it in the high scores page.

There are many controls which the user can press to suit their play style:
Jump - Space, Up key, W
Left - Left key, A
Right - Right key, D
Down - Down key, S


--------- Known Issues/Bugs:
----------------------------
Level 11 may cause some lag as it is a large level, with many objects being rendered on the screen. However this bug only affects certain computers so we were unsure what the cause was.

When a level is won and you return to the level select screen, the next highlighted level is not always the next level for you to complete.

There is a ~10 seconds loading time when opening the game. It is not frozen, we have just used many different images and sound files that are initialised on the game start.

This game was built on Java 1.7 and will not run on Java 1.6 or below.
